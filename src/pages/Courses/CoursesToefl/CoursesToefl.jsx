              The TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) is an English
              proficiency test that is widely used for admission to universities
              and colleges in English-speaking countries. The test measures the
              ability of non-native English speakers to understand and use
              English in an academic setting. The test is administered by the
              Educational Testing Service (ETS) and is accepted by over 11,000
              universities and colleges in more than 150 countries. The TOEFL
              iBT (Internet-based Test) is the most commonly used format of the
              test. It replaced the computer-based test (CBT) and paper-based
              test (PBT) formats in most countries. The test measures four basic
              language skills, including reading, listening, speaking, and
              writing. Each section is scored on a scale of 0-30, and the total
              score ranges from 0-120. The test takes about four hours to
              complete.
              <br />
              Initially, there was a high demand for test seats, and candidates
              had to wait for months to take the test. However, it is now
              possible to take the test within one to four weeks in most
              countries. Candidates are allowed to take the test multiple times,
              but they must wait at least 12 days before retaking the test. The
              TOEFL iBT test is administered at authorized test centers around
              the world. Test takers must register online and pay the test fee
              in advance. Test centers are designed to be controlled
              environments, and strict security measures are in place to prevent
              cheating. Many universities and colleges require a minimum TOEFL
              score for admission. The required score varies depending on the
              institution and the program of study. A score of 100 or higher is
              generally considered good, while a score of 90 or lower may limit
              the choice of universities and programs.

                <br />
                Reading
              </strong>
              <br />
              The Reading section of the TOEFL iBT test consists of questions
              based on 4-6 passages, each around 700 words long, and on academic
              topics. The questions require an understanding of rhetorical
              functions like cause-effect, compare-contrast, and argumentation.
              The questions can be about main ideas, details, inferences,
              essential information, sentence insertion, vocabulary, rhetorical
              purpose, and overall ideas. In addition, the TOEFL iBT test has
              introduced new types of questions that require filling out tables
              or completing summaries. Prior knowledge of the subject is not
              required to answer the questions correctly
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Listening</strong>
              <br />
              The Listening section consists of six passages, each 3-5 minutes
              in length, which include two student conversations and four
              academic lectures or discussions. The conversations involve a
              student and either a professor or a campus service provider, while
              the lectures are a self-contained portion of an academic lecture,
              which may involve student participation and does not assume
              specialized background knowledge in the subject area. Each
              conversation and lecture passage is heard only once, and
              test-takers may take notes while they listen and may refer to
              their notes when they answer the questions. Each conversation is
              associated with five questions, and each lecture with six. The
              questions measure the ability to understand main ideas, important
              details, implications, relationships between ideas, organization
              of information, speaker purpose, and speaker attitude.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Speaking</strong>
              <br />
              The Speaking section of the TOEFL iBT consists of six tasks, two
              independent and four integrated. The independent tasks require
              test-takers to answer opinion questions on familiar topics, while
              the integrated tasks require test-takers to read a short passage,
              listen to an academic course lecture or conversation, and then
              answer questions by combining appropriate information from the
              text and the talk or responding to a question about what they
              heard. In all six tasks, test-takers are evaluated on their
              ability to communicate their ideas clearly and coherently. Their
              responses are digitally recorded, sent to ETS's Online Scoring
              Network, and evaluated by three to six raters
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Writing</strong>
              <br />
              The Writing section of the TOEFL iBT test consists of two tasks,
              one integrated and one independent. In the integrated task,
              test-takers read a passage on an academic topic and then listen to
              a speaker discuss it. The test-taker then writes a summary about
              the important points in the listening passage and explains how
              these relate to the key points of the reading passage. In the
              independent task, the test-taker must write an essay that states
              their opinion or choice and explains it, rather than simply
              listing personal preferences or choices. The responses are
              digitally recorded, sent to ETS's Online Scoring Network (OSN),
              and evaluated by at least three different raters..

              During the TOEFL test, there will be an additional section that
              contains unscored questions. The Educational Testing Service
              incorporates these questions to experiment with potential
              questions for future tests. It is important for test-takers to put
              in the same amount of effort for all questions, as they will not
              know which ones are unscored. For instance, if there are four
              reading passages in the test instead of the usual three, one of
              the passages will be unscored. It could be any of the four
              passages.

              <strong>TOEFL iBT Test</strong>
              <br />
              The TOEFL iBT test is scored on a scale of 0 to 120 points.
              <br />
              A score from 0 to 30 is given for each of the four sections,
              namely Reading, Listening, Speaking, and Writing. The sum of the
              scaled scores of these four sections yields the total score. The
              individual scores for each speaking question range from 0 to 4,
              and for each writing question, they range from 0 to 5, but these
              scores are later transformed to scaled scores of 0 to 30.

              <br />
              TOEFL scores are typically just one of several criteria that
              colleges use to evaluate candidates for admission. In many cases,
              a specific college or program within a college will establish a
              minimum required TOEFL score. This minimum score can vary
              significantly, with some institutions, such as Bowling Green State
              University, requiring a score as low as 61, while others, like
              MIT, require a much higher score of at least 90.
              <br />
              ETS has released tables to convert between iBT, CBT and PBT
              scores.
