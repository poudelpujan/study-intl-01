              The acronym GED stands for General Educational Development,
              although some people mistakenly call it the General Educational
              Diploma or the General Equivalency Diploma. In reality, the GED is
              a program that allows individuals to obtain a certificate or
              credential equivalent to a high school diploma by passing the GED
              Test provided by GED Testing Service.
              <br />
              If you are 16 years or older, taking the GED® test can give you
              the chance to obtain a certificate or diploma that is widely
              recognized as being equivalent to a high school diploma. If you
              achieve scores on the GED® test that are equivalent to those of
              recent high school graduates, many colleges and universities may
              accept your GED® certification for admission. As more than 17
              million individuals have passed their GED® tests since the
              inception of the program in 1942, it is likely that you will fit
              in seamlessly on a university campus after successfully completing
              your test.
              <br />
              The GED® test can only be taken at authorized GED® test centers
              worldwide, and it cannot be taken online. If you are planning to
              prepare for the GED® test, it is recommended that you visit the
              official GED® test website as it provides crucial information
              about the test, including testing centers, test dates, and the
              requirements necessary for achieving passing scores and obtaining
              GED® test certification..
              <br />
              The GED® test consists of five parts
              <br />
              To start preparing for the GED® test, it is important to
              understand the test's structure and content. Passing all five
              tests is required to obtain your GED® diploma or certificate.
              <br />
              The Language Arts, Writing test requires you to respond to
              multiple-choice questions that ask you to spot and correct errors
              in sentence structure, usage, mechanics, and organization.
              Additionally, you will need to write an essay expressing your
              opinion and discussing your thoughts on a subject or issue that is
              generally of interest.
              <br />
              This passage describes the Social Studies test in the GED® exam.
              The test consists of multiple-choice questions on subjects such as
              history, economics, geography, civics, and government. It
              evaluates the test-taker's knowledge of basic principles in these
              areas, and requires them to read and interpret passages, cartoons,
              graphs, and charts. There are separate versions of the Social
              Studies test for the United States and Canada..
              <br />
              <br />
              To pass the Science test, you need to answer multiple-choice
              questions based on life science, earth and space science, and
              physical science (chemistry and physics). The questions will
              require you to have good reading comprehension, specific knowledge
              of science, and the ability to interpret scientific data presented
              in various forms, such as graphs, maps, tables, figures, and
              charts.
              <br />
              In the Language Arts, Reading test, you will be presented with
              around seven excerpts from various sources, such as newspapers,
              magazines, novels, short stories, poetry, drama, and business or
              legal documents. The test consists of multiple-choice questions
              designed to assess your comprehension of both fiction and
              nonfiction materials
              <br />
              <br />
              The Mathematics test consists of various types of questions
              related to algebra, measurement, geometry, number theory, data
              analysis, and probability. Most questions are word problems that
              present real-life scenarios or require interpretation of data
              presented in graphs, charts, tables, and diagrams. The test is
              divided into two parts, with Part I allowing the use of a
              calculator while Part II does not. The test center provides a
              Casio fx-260 calculator for use during the exam, and it is
              recommended to become familiar with its operation before taking
              the test. A page of math formulas is also provided, and answers
              will be recorded on standard or coordinate plane grids.

              This paragraph emphasizes that the official GED test is not
              administered online and must be taken at one of over 3,400
              authorized testing centers worldwide. It suggests that those
              preparing for the GED test should visit the official GED test
              website, which provides valuable information about the test
              content, including sample questions, testing locations, test
              dates, and requirements for passing the test and earning GED test
              certification.
              <br />
              <br />
              The GED® test was initially developed in 1942 by the American
              Council on Education (ACE) at the request of the United States
              Armed Forces Institute. The purpose was to provide returning
              veterans with a way to demonstrate their high school-level
              academic skills, which would help them secure employment and
              pursue higher education opportunities.
              <br />
              <br />
              GED tests were revised in 1988 to include a writing sample or
              essay and to place more emphasis on socially relevant topics and
              problem-solving skills. The fourth revision was made in 2002 to
              comply with more recent standards for high-school education, and
              the fifth revision was released on January 2, 2014, to be
              delivered on Pearson VUE, a proprietary computer-based testing
              platform.
              <br />
              The Official GED Testing Centers are highly controlled
              environments, and all testing sessions take place in person. There
              are specific rules and security measures enforced, and there may
              be restrictions on what test-takers can bring into the testing
              room. The GED test is a standardized test with several forms in
              circulation, calibrated to the same level of difficulty. The
              possible scores on an individual test within the GED battery range
              from a minimum of 200 to a maximum of 800. ACE issues
              recommendations for minimum passing scores for each sub-test and
              for the test as a whole, but jurisdictions may establish higher
              standards if they choose. Many institutions regard the GED test
              credential as equivalent to a high school diploma, but the U.S.
              military has higher requirements for GED test takers.
